Description: An implementation of the methods of <paper> in R.
    Contains methods for quantifying the degree of association between pairs of discrete 
    event time series, focusing on the case where two associated event series exhibit temporal 
    clustering such that the occurrence of one type of event at a particular time increases 
    the likelihood that an event of the other type will also occur nearby in time. Multiple
    different score functions are used to quantify association, including characteristics of 
    marked point processes and summary statistics for inter-event times. Two techniques are 
    currently implemented for assessing the degree of associaton: (i) a population-based approach 
    to calculate score-based likelihood ratios when a sample from a relevant population is 
    available, and (ii) a resampling approach to compute coincidental match probabilities when 
    only a single pair of event series is available.
